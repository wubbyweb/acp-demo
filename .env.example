# Example environment variables
# If your agent needs to connect to external services (e.g., an LLM API),
# you would store API keys and other configurations here.

# For example, if using OpenAI:
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
# LLM_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"

# For this basic demonstration, no environment variables are strictly required
# by the course_generation_agent itself, but pydantic-settings is included
# in pyproject.toml as a good practice for when you might need them.
